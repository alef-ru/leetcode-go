# leetcode-go
I'm learning Go.
After many years of Python, it takes a while, got get used to pointers and slices. So,i decided solve a few problems from LeetCode to get a good grip.

Path to the file corresponds the problem URL. E.g. `/problems/partition-list.go` is https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
